PMTK relies on various other packages which are available from [pmtksupport](http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport). In addition, several smaller files have been contributed directly to PMTK, as detailed below.

The following entries are auto-generated by generateAuthorLocReport.m, and generateAuthorReport, which rely on the contributed files containing PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate tags. If we have included one of your files but we forgot to include a relevant tag, please let us know, so you can be credited appropriately.
